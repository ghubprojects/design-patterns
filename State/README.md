# State

> State is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.

## Applicability

- Use the State pattern when you have an object that behaves differently depending on its current state, the number of states is enormous, and the state-specific code changes frequently.
- Use the pattern when you have a class polluted with massive conditionals that alter how the class behaves according to the current values of the class’s fields.
- Use State when you have a lot of duplicate code across similar states and transitions of a condition-based state machine.

## Pros and Cons
- *Single Responsibility Principle*. Organize the code related to particular states into separate classes.
- *Open/Closed Principle*. Introduce new states without changing existing state classes or the context.
- Simplify the code of the context by eliminating bulky state machine conditionals.

- Applying the pattern can be overkill if a state machine has only a few states or rarely changes.
