# Mediator

> Mediator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects. The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator object.

## Applicability

- Use the Mediator pattern when it’s hard to change some of the classes because they are tightly coupled to a bunch of other classes.
- Use the pattern when you can’t reuse a component in a different program because it’s too dependent on other components.
- Use the Mediator when you find yourself creating tons of component subclasses just to reuse some basic behavior in various contexts.

## Pros and Cons
- *Single Responsibility Principle*. You can extract the communications between various components into a single place, making it easier to comprehend and maintain.
- *Open/Closed Principle*. You can introduce new mediators without having to change the actual components.
- You can reduce coupling between various components of a program.
- You can reuse individual components more easily.

- Over time a mediator can evolve into a **God Object**.
